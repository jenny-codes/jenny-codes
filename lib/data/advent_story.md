"Haiya. Another 8pm meeting." Thought Joyce. "Getting in the way of meeting my wonderful, sweet, absolutely-right girlfriend. What is adulting." As she plopped into her desk chair, she looked out through the window. It had gone completely dark hours ago. The relentless November wind seemed to only get stronger. A wistful image of Jenny in her volleyball jersey flickered through her mind. Shaking it off, she tuned into the virtual call, her face arranging itself into the familiar mask of pleasant attentiveness.

As the usual faces began to trickle into the virtual room, she felt...something was weird. Not from the screen. She looked down at the "superstar! I got my COVID-19 shot" sticker that she was fidgeting with, and realized it's...glowing?

Huh?

The glow intensified, spilling over the cartoon letters. Then came a great, pulling sensation, not from below, but from the sticker itself. It tugged at her arm, then her whole being, as the sticker grew, expanding with an impossible, silent speed. The cartoon star swelled until it was the size of her monitor, then the wall, soon, her entire room was gone, replaced by a dizzying, swirling vortex of stars.

"...much wow?" was her last thought before she sank deep, deep into the current.

"Ah, my back," Joyce grumbles as she climbed the stairs out of the subway station. As she emerged into the snow-covered February air, she tried to shake off the remnants of a very strange dream she’d had while dozing on the train. There was a collage of half-memories: an 8pm meeting...someone in a black volleyball jersey that looked very, very good on them...stars...falling...

She was running errands in the neighbourhood she was moving to tomorrow. It wouldn't be the first time she’d lived in downtown Toronto, but it would be the first time she'd have a room that was entirely her own.

"(Cough) Um, hello?" Suddenly, a voice came. From inside her head.

"What do you mean??" Joyce growled in disbelief.

"Ah, yes. It appears we've encountered an unexpected user onboarding flow in the game," the voice continued.

"Wait what? What game? Who are you? And why are you in my head?"

"Oh no. This is also indicative of the malfunction. Hmm. The parameters may have exceeded initial projections. This might not go well. Oh well."

"...'Oh well'!?"

"Um, I mean, rest assured we are actioning a deep-dive to leverage our core competencies and remediate this unfortunate outcome. We understand your frustration—which is a key pain point we're tracking—and will circle back once we have a more granular go-forward strategy."

"Stop with the corporate speak." Joyce in a deadpan voice.

"Okay, phew. Honestly? Running out of bandwidth for that dialect anyway. So, like, no cap, the whole situation is a major L right now. The vibe is... not it. It's giving main character tragedy arc, you feel me?"

"Stop with the Gen Z speak." Joyce's patience is wearing very thin.

"...fine. I practiced hard and have grown rather fond of that though. Sigh. Byebye my hard work. Anyway, okay. Let me verify your identity first."

"...Why do you need authentication when you can already pry into my head? And who are you!??"

"...you...shush. Although, I find that rather stupid too. But trust me it, the faster we get this over with, the faster I will be able to answer your questions."

"Okay. Let's get this over with." Joyce conceded with a sigh.

"Let's go. First, what's your name?"

"Joyce"

"What piece of clothing is the most scandalous?"

"No-show socks. Because they reveal the ankles."

Very good. Final question: what is the name of that establishment where food may or may not be their main focus, but does have a good chicken wings deal on Mondays?
