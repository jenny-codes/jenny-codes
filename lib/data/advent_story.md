"Haiya. Another 8pm meeting." Thought Joyce. "Getting in the way of meeting my wonderful, sweet, absolutely-right girlfriend. What is adulting." As she plopped into her desk chair, she looked out through the window. It had gone completely dark hours ago. The relentless November wind seemed to only get stronger. A wistful image of Jenny in her volleyball jersey flickered through her mind. Shaking it off, she tuned into the virtual call, her face arranging itself into the familiar mask of pleasant attentiveness.

As the usual faces began to trickle into the virtual room, she felt...something was weird. Not from the screen. She looked down at the "superstar! I got my COVID-19 shot" sticker that she was fidgeting with, and realized it's...glowing?

Huh?

The glow intensified, spilling over the cartoon letters. Then came a great, pulling sensation, not from below, but from the sticker itself. It tugged at her arm, then her whole being, as the sticker grew, expanding with an impossible, silent speed. The cartoon star swelled until it was the size of her monitor, then the wall, soon, her entire room was gone, replaced by a dizzying, swirling vortex of stars.

"...much wow?" was her last thought before she sank deep, deep into the current.

"Ah my back"

The sinking stopped with a sudden stillness that was more shocking than any impact. Joyce found herself standing on a pavement in the biting cold. Everything was so oddly familiar. She looked around. It felt like Toronto.

Above her, a large digital clock on a building corner glowed with a severe red light. It read: FEB 12, 2025.

"February?" Joyce murmured. Somehow...something is off. Somewhere in the back of her mind a voice is telling her that the Deciding that standing still was the least productive thing one could do, she began to walk along the street, which the road signs said Adelaide.

"...I live here now don't I" It seems that her memory is somehow reshuffled. "I will...figure this all out later." Her body is still faithfully taking her forward while she procrastinates figuring out what exactly is being weird. After a while, she came to an intersection. Across the road sat a two-storey establishment that pulsed with a startling, electric, marmalade orange. It was so bright, so cheerfully aggressive, that it seemed to be the source of all light on the street, and it beckoned her closer.

As she drew near, she saw a sign, written in fat, cheerful letters, curving across its facade. Joyce stopped directly beneath it, her head tilted back, her breath fogging in the not-quite-real February air, and read the glowing text.

Hooters. "But today is not Monday. They don't have wings." Joyce thought. And stopped.
