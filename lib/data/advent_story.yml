  "Haiya. Another 8pm meeting." Thought Joyce. "Getting in the way of meeting my wonderful, sweet, absolutely-right girlfriend. What is adulting." As she plopped into her desk chair, she looked out through the window. It had gone completely dark hours ago. The relentless November wind seemed to only get stronger. A wistful image of Jenny in her volleyball jersey flickered through her mind. Shaking it off, she tuned into the virtual call, her face arranging itself into the familiar mask of pleasant attentiveness.

  As the usual faces began to trickle into the virtual room, she felt...something was weird. Not from the screen. She looked down at the "superstar! I got my COVID-19 shot" sticker that she was fidgeting with, and realized it's...glowing?

  Huh?

  The glow intensified, spilling over the cartoon letters. Then came a great, pulling sensation, not from below, but from the sticker itself. It tugged at her arm, then her whole being, as the sticker grew, expanding with an impossible, silent speed. The cartoon star swelled until it was the size of her monitor, then the wall, soon, her entire room was gone, replaced by a dizzying, swirling vortex of stars.

  "...much wow?" was her last thought before she sank deep, deep into the current.

"20251109": |-
  "Ah, my back," Joyce grumbles as she climbed the stairs out of the subway station. As she emerged into the snow-covered February air, she tried to shake off the remnants of a very strange dream she’d had while dozing on the train. There was a collage of half-memories: an 8pm meeting...someone in a black volleyball jersey that looked very, very good on them...stars...falling...

  She was running errands in the neighbourhood she was moving to tomorrow. It wouldn't be the first time she’d lived in downtown Toronto, but it would be the first time she'd have a room that was entirely her own.

  "(Cough) Um, hello?" Suddenly, a voice came. From inside her head.

  "What do you mean??" Joyce growled in disbelief.

  "Ah, yes. It appears we've encountered an unexpected user onboarding flow in the game," the voice continued.

  "Wait what? What game? Who are you? And why are you in my head?"

  "Oh no. This is also indicative of the malfunction. Hmm. The parameters may have exceeded initial projections. This might not go well. Oh well."

  "...'Oh well'!?"

  "Um, I mean, rest assured we are actioning a deep-dive to leverage our core competencies and remediate this unfortunate outcome. We understand your frustration—which is a key pain point we're tracking—and will circle back once we have a more granular go-forward strategy."

  "Stop with the corporate speak." Joyce said, deadpan.

  "Okay, phew. Honestly? Running out of bandwidth for that dialect anyway. So, like, no cap, the whole situation is a major L right now. The vibe is... not it. It's giving main character tragedy arc, you feel me?"

  "Stop with the Gen Z speak." Joyce's patience is wearing very thin.

  "...fine. I practiced hard and have grown rather fond of that though. Sigh. Byebye my hard work. Anyway, okay. Let me verify your identity first."

  "...Why do you need authentication when you can already pry into my head? And who are you!??"

  "...you...shush. Although, I find that rather silly too. But trust me it, the faster we get this over with, the faster I will be able to answer your questions. First, what is your name?"

  "Joyce. This is stupid."

  "What piece of clothing is the most scandalous?"

  "No-show socks. Because they reveal the ankles."

  Very good. Final question: what is the name of that establishment where food may or may not be their main focus, but does have a good chicken wings deal on Mondays?

"20251110": |-
  "Hooters," the voice confirmed, with the air of a game show host confirming a prize-winning answer. "A correct identification. You seem quite emphatic about it. ALL CAPS?"

  "...don't worry about it. Now, what is this game and why are you in my head?" To punctuate the question, and to test the very integrity of this reality, Joyce stalked over to the nearest wall, and gave it a solid kick.

  "Ouch!" The pain that shot up her leg was definitely real.

  "Why did you initiate a wall-walking sequence and then abort on the first step?" The voice asked with an air of genuine scientific curiosity.

  "...That was a kick."

  "Oh. I see."

  "You are judging me. Stop it."

  "I didn't say anything! Ahem, anyway," continued the voice, "this game I have been referring to is..."

  "Hmm?"

  "..."

  "...?"

  "...a game."

  "Ok have a nice day I would like to log out of whatever this is now bye bye"

  "I am sorry but you have to stay with me for a while." The voice actually managed to sound apologetic. "The game doesn't have a formal name yet as it's still in a pre-beta development phase. But we developers do have a nickname for it. 'That Game Where You Collect Stars When Going About Your Everyday Activities'"

  "I feel that is unnecessarily long for a nickname. It doesn't even rhyme."

  "What do you mean? It is such a catchy nickname that says it all! Anyway, this game was developed with the goal of adding some...behavioral incentives for people to make good choices. We designed for pre-teen children as a form of early-stage behaviour conditioning. When a kid encounters a morally ambiguous situation, the game will activate. When they make the right decision, the game will reward them with a star. So they can be trained from a young age to make good decisions and be better adults when they grow up. We are in the first stage of testing now, and to ensure our subjects were of our targeted age, our demographic filter was to randomly select subjects from the pool of recipients of the 'superstar! I got my COVID-19 shot!' sticker."

  "...Which included me, a 26-year-old."

  "We simply didn't expect someone as old as you would get the sticker."

  Joyce wanted to protest but...fair point. "I don't even remember taking a flu shot. How weird. Also, now I have even more questions. First of all, I didn't consent to any of these. How did I become the subject? Also, what counts as a morally ambiguous situation?"

  "Oh but you did give your consent. Remember that one time you streamed a baseball event from Daddylive? If you had perused the Terms of Service section 133 subection 121.9 clause 42, on the back of line three it did say 'and I hereby agree to participate wholeheartedly in the game colloquially nicknamed "That Game Where You Collect Stars When Going About Your Everyday Activities" at my own personal physical and mental risk.'"

  "Very sus, to say the least. Be honest, are you for real? And WHAT DO YOU MEAN physical and mental risk!??"

  "I...want to tell you don't worry about that but...maybe worry a little bit? A fractional amount. A light touch of worry is probably appropriate. You don't have to worry too much. Yet. Anyway! The important thing is that you are here now, so let's focus on that. So," its tone brightening with the unmistakable relief of someone who has successfully dodged a very difficult question, "you asked what situations are defined as morally ambiguous. Easy. For example, when you find a wallet full of cash on the road, do you take the cash and leave the wallet, or do you try to return it to its owner? Another good example would be: you are walking on a mildly busy street and wish to cross. The nearest designated crosswalk is a whole ten metres away. You see a momentary lull in traffic, do you jaywalk?"

"20251111": |-
  "I will not dignify that with a response." The voice.

  "But you just did. With that statement." Joyce, calmly.

  "..."

  "...🙂"

  "Anyway. That was the idea behind the game. But it seems the situation has gone a bit out of control. Because you are so old..."

  "Rude!"

  "...your cognitive architecture is more or less fully developed, leaving no room for the game to inject the necessary augmented reality overlays. From the logs I have, it appears the system made several valiant attempts to interface with your neural pathways. When that failed, it gave up and decided to...well..."

  "Decided to what??"

  "Decided to instantiate new reality, dial everything back 9 months...and throw you into it."

  "So you are saying I am now in this parallel reality where there is another Joyce right now living in the main one, 9 months into the future?"

  "Yes."

  "And how do I go back?"

  "The only way you can get back is to get the system to voluntarily put you back, which I don't know exactly how to achieve."

  "Ok one sec I will start panicking now." Joyce closed her eyes. Strangely, she felt extremely calm.

  "Based on what I know of the system though, I think the biggest chance we have to escape before this reality falls apart is to try to play the game and collect the stars. There is a specific number of stars that marks the 'win' condition. Once you reach that number, the game should terminate, and you should be successfully ejected."

  "What is this number? And why would this reality fall apart?

  "I had that number code somewhere but...after a few minor, harmless code refactorings and config updates, this number now is nowhere to be traced. If my memory serves me correctly, I think it's around 13? As for the collapse... it's a resource issue. It's expensive to run an entire alternative world, you see. This system has the approximate power draw of a small moon, and... well, we haven't been exactly paying the electricity bill."

  "But if the system loses power I would simply go back to my original world. Right??"

  "It's more complicated than that. Think of it less as 'going back' and more as...how do I put it more politely...'ceasing to be in a somewhat untidy fashion'. You really don't want that to happen."

  There was a long pause.

  "You're saying my continued existence now depends on the bureaucratic inefficiency of an energy company failing to notice a colossal unpaid bill?"

  "More like, you are now in a race against it. If you complete the game before they cut the power, there will be a non-zero chance you should remain...intact?"

  "Which brings me to my next question. One that you have been avoiding for a while now. Who, or what, are you?"

  "I am the remnant consciousness of one of the game's developers. I believe when the system generated this new reality, it accidentally copied my consciousness along with your file."

  "So you are like a Siri?"

  A visibly offended gasp from the voice: "I am much better than a siri!"

  "Can you play music from my Spotify?"

  "I don't have access to your Spotify account."

  "Can you read today's weather to me?"

  "How would I know today's weather? You tell me."

  "Can you remind me to take out trash tomorrow morning?"

  "Why would I want to do that!?"

  "."

  "Ok I see your point. But! I can hack into a specific surveillance camera at a zoo in rural Sichuan, which is currently focused on a newborn litter of sugar gliders. They are very cute. Would you like to see them?"

  "No. Can you hack into any other surveillance camera?"

  "That is the only surveillance camera I am able to hack into."

  "..."

  "I see that you are not impressed."

  "So, to summarize: my life depends on me winning a child's morality game with an unknown score target before the server farm running my universe has its power cut. And my only assistance is a disembodied programmer who can show me tiny animals."

  "I am as dismayed as you are to be trapped here with you okay?"

  "At the very least tell me what is today's Redactle answer?"

"20251112": |-
  "Ah, you like to play Redactle too? Good taste. But why did you need me to tell you the answer? You already got it," the voice commented.

  "I was testing your capabilities. I guess you are not entirely useless, although still quite limited. Are you sure you don't want to go learn a trick or two from Siri? A built-in alarm clock would be nice," mused Joyce.

  "Rude!"

  It was, Joyce had realized, again and again, a truly bizarre situation. The explanations the voice had given her kind of make sense but also...don't? Everything was so absurd that even the threat that something terrible would happen if she didn't cooperate didn't feel real. Still, on the off-chance that any of this actually mattered... she might as well play along. If nothing else, she could try to extract more information from the voice.

  "Okay, let's get this over with," she sighed. "What's the most efficient way to create a situation that will trigger the game and get me a star?"

  "You are trying to game the system. I am afraid it won't work. The system is smart. Very smart. It's designed to read your intent. In fact, that's what made integration testing so difficult... it simply wouldn't respond to our simulated scenarios. We never really figured out a way to truly test it."

  "...Are you telling me this whole thing is untested? You just pushed the code to production and hoped it wouldn't explode? Am I your production test?"

  "Our funds were constrained," the voice said, sounding defensive. "We didn't have a lot of runway for anything beyond core feature development. They weren't exactly passionate about this particular project..."

  "That sounds very much like an excuse for crappy code and no testing. And who is 'they'?"

  "They're the higher-ups in the Collective. They've been funding our work, but reluctantly. We were all worried they'd pull the plug one day and we wouldn't be able to pay our bills."

  "But you already can't." Also, Collective? Joyce thought she's had more than her fair share of dealing with collectives this year.

  "Anyway, the point is, I don't think you can fool the system," the voice continued, changing the subject. "You just have to let things happen, and the game should activate naturally. Believe me, I've tried. I couldn't trick it once. One time, I even had this genius idea—I designed a scenario where a runaway trolley was heading towards five people, but the subject could pull a lever to redirect it towards one person. The subject had to make the tough choice of letting trolley kill five people versus one person. What a genius moral dilemma!"

  "That's the classic trolley problem," Joyce said flatly. "You threw it at a pre-teen? Must have been traumatizing for them. I hope you are paying their therapy bills."

  "Uh. Well. It didn't work anyway. It nearly crushed the system because it caused a massive deadlock in the morality engine."

  While they were talking, Joyce had been walking toward her new place, the one across from Hooters. Now she stepped inside, the door clicking shut behind her. "Phew. I'm home." Somehow, it felt like days had passed since she stepped out of that subway station. Like, three days.

  "Hello home I'm the voice in your head."

  "Haha."

  "Good. You appreciate my humour. We can coexist."

  "...'Appreciate' is a strong word. So, what you're saying is the best course of action is to just... chill? And wait for stars to magically appear or for reality to explode?" If that was the case, Joyce thought, she might as well go check out that badminton group she'd been meaning to join. What was it called... Queer Toronto Badminton? Or Queer Badminton Toronto? Anyway, she remembered the ad said it was in the basement of a community center...

"20251113": |-
  As she approaches the community center, a familiar cold dread, otherwise known as social anxiety, began to do laps in her stomach. A whole group of new people at once.

  Joyce was nervous.

  What if everyone was a tight-knit clique? What if she was terrible? What if...no one was funny!??

  "You came all this way," she said to herself, taking a deep breath of something that might have been courage, or recycled gym air, and stepped inside.

  ---

  People were already playing. That whole episode with the voice made her late, but fortunately it looks like the games were just starting. The sound of squeaking shoes, echoing shouts, and the thonk of birdies filled the space. People were chattering on the benches by the wall. Some small laughes erupting here and there. "Vibe not bad eh," she thought, and started scanning the courts. Her eyes wandered, and stopped.

  There was a woman on the far court, mid-rally, ponytail cutting arcs through the air as she moved. She just made an accurate cross-net drop shot, which caught the other side by surprise.

  "Smart. That's my kind of shots," nodded Joyce approvingly. She continued to watch this woman for a while, silently cheering as she landed one well-placed winner after another. Joyce decided, with a certainty that surprised her, that she wanted to play with her.

  When the game wrapped, the woman turned, and as she started walking back, Joyce saw her face. As she took it in, her brain went..."ah?"

  It was the ghost of a memory. A phantom limb of recognition. The sensation was entirely unfamiliar. Joyce was certain she hasn't seen this face before but... there was an unmistakable pull. A feeling of...closeness. Who is she!?

  "Whoa, this is the biggest emotional fluctation I've registered from you since we met," the voice cut in.

  "You mean, since you invited yourself into my head?" Joyce rolled her eyes, hoping the sensation would be transmitted along with her thought.

  "Court! Wanna go?" Someone was inviting her to play. Joyce's eyes follow the woman, made sure that she was heading towards that empty court, and said "yeah I'll go."

  They took their positions on opposite side of the net. Joyce felt like there was a red-winged blackbird flapping in her chest. A nervous energy that actually felt kind of good. She felt intimidated because... she wanted to impress this woman.

  A few rallies went by. The games were, as she predicted, a lot of fun. They were the same kind of players, prioritizing smart placement over brute force. She was genuinely enjoying it. Halfway through the game, Joyce, in a slipped moment, sent a shot flying high to the mid-court, where the woman was already waiting. She just gave the woman the perfect opportunity for an attack. "Je-doomed" thought Joyce, and scrambled into a defensive position. The woman reared back her racket, and with lethal intent, swung...! at nothing but air. The birdie fell with a light thonk, untouched.

  "Um," she looked a little bit embarrassed at the birdie she just missed entirely, but with a smirk on her face, "must be the drift," as she gestured towards what was clearly a wall.

  And just like that, the tension in Joyce's shoulders vanished. "Cute." She murmured to herself.

  The rest of the game loosened into something more playful. The score at the end was a complete blur. When they met at the net to tap rackets, the woman said, "I'm Jenny."

  "Joyce."

  "You're good."

  "You as well."

  They smiled at each other.

  At that moment, a sound like a dial-up modem hitting the jackpot screeched in her head. It was followed by the visual of a glowing, lopsided, vaguely-yellow blob squished into her mind's eye. It wasn't so much of a star as an abstract post-modern suggestion of a star, rendered in what looked like 8-bit graphics. It pulsed unevenly, as if it wasn't quite sure how to be, and emitted a noise very much like a kazoo. Joyce blinked. "Is this...a star?" she whispered.

  "Well shaped stars were not part of the core feature development cycle," the voice said defensively. "They were a stretch goal."

  The blob burped and dissolved into a shower of sparkles. Afterwards, the words show up "YOU DID WELL! YOU GOT A STAR!"

"20251114": |-
  As a secret detective, Jenny was pretty good at her job. No one ever told her that, but no one had to. Everyone knew. She maintained a cover—a side gig, really—as a software engineer in a tech company, which is what she usually told people about at parties.

  But when a case came... well, that was different. A proper case didn't arrive via email or a phone call. It arrived when someone managed to crack through her carefully designed back door on her website, and filled in the google form waiting behind the door. Yes, she picked clients too. If you were good enough to find it, you earned her time.

  This time, the situation was truly unusual.

  "An augmented reality game," Jenny mused, "that went awry during pre-beta testing and instantiated a divergent timeline. Fascinating indeed." The fact that it is even possible may have rendered some of the long-debated physics theories obsolete. But she would not be distracted by that now. The client wanted her to go into this split reality, investigate what might have gone wrong, and rescue the person trapped inside.

  "So who is this person?" Jenny asked.

  "Due to confidentiality protocals, we cannot disclose the subject's identity."

  "...you want me to rescue someone but you won't tell me who it is?"

  "I'm afraid you have to figure that out yourself," the client said, "which I am sure you are capable of. What I can tell you is this: they are located in downtown Toronto."

  "Downtown Toronto. You do realize that narrows it down to a search of three hundred thousand people, right? You said there is a risk of 'unrecoverable damage' to the person if it is not resolved soon. Doesn't that trump whatever this confidentiality agreement is?"

  "No," the client replied simply. "But here is a tool. It will beep when it detects any unusual vibe activity."

  Jenny looked at the device that got handed to her. It was a palm-sized, rainbow-coloured plastic gadget. On the front was a cartoon turtle with enormous eyes. A dialogue bubble above its head read "Weee!"

  "As open minded as I pride myself to be, I...X for doubt. This is a kid's toy. And what is this 'unusual vibe activity'?"

  "Oh you know, those wave thingy that comes with augmented reality events," the client waved their hand in a vague, hazy fashion. "Don't worry about its appearance. We specifically designed it to be inconspicuous, so you can carry it around without attracting unwanted attention."

  Jenny looked at the gadget again, which had begun to flash with multi-coloured disco lights, while a tiny speaker blasted a surprisingly catchy "happy happy happy" commercial jingle in a cappella.

  Jenny stared at the client.

  The client stared back.

  She calmly found a small, unmarked button on the back of the happy turtle and pressed it, silencing the chaos.

  "I can work with this," she managed.

  "Wonderful. I will send you off then. Bye bye."

  At that, a gentle yellow light began to rise around her, and eventually engulfed her whole body. "Here we go," Jenny thought, and closed her eyes.

"20251115": |-
  When Jenny came to, she was lying on the couch in her own condo. The happy turtle sat quietly in her palm. Everything looked the same, just... newer? A quick glance at her calendar confirmed it. "I am in February 2025 now," she announced to herself. The client could've mentioned this. Sigh. Jenny wondered how many more surprises are waiting for her.

  She immediately fished out her phone, fingers hovering over the screen to text Joyce. 

  .

  ..

  ...

  "Ah," she said out loud to the empty room. "Right. We haven't met yet."

  She checked the date again. February 9th. Today was the day they met, at Queer Badminton.

  "Well," she thought, squishing the happy turtle, "whoever the trapped person is, they will have to wait. I am going to go meet my future girlfriend."

  ---

  Jenny was early to the community center. She was... ridiculously nervous. Her job involved detecting multinational fraud crimes and navigating high-stake off-by-one currency exchange rate discrepencies, but this felt infinitely more terrifying. What if things didn't go as they did in her timeline? What if she said something stupid and Joyce decided she was weird? What if Joyce didn't show up at all? This might be a fake reality, but the thought of a universe where she didn't get to meet Joyce was unacceptable.

  The game started. Joyce was nowhere to be seen. Jenny's anxiety mounted with each passing shot. Then, a flash of red in her peripheral vision. A familiar blue badminton case came to the corner of her eyes. Joyce had arrived.

  Jenny was surprised at how her breath catches still whenever she sees Joyce. Her heart did a little leap, and in a perfect sympathetic motion, so did her racket. It was a purely reflexive, subconscious flick of the wrist, but the birdie flew beautifully over the net, a perfect cross-court drop shot that landed with impossible grace.

  "Whoa," Jenny thought. "That might be the best drop shot I've ever played. Good job, subconscious. Or good job, Joyce?" She fought the overwhelming urge to turn and stare, but she could feel Joyce's eyes on her. She knew she was watching.

  The next game, they were on opposite sides of the net. Jenny looked at Joyce, her mind a dizzying montage of memories that hadn't happened yet—playing guitar while stealing glances of each other, the many, many audacious flirts at the net, waking up next to her in bed...hmm bed... 
  
  "Thonk." A birdie landed at her side. "We serve first," her teammate called out. Jenny blushed a little bit, picked up the birdie, and started the game.

  When the game ended, they met at the net to tap rackets and exchange names. For a split second, Jenny saw it: Joyce's eyes went distant, her expression distracted, as if she were listening to someone only she could hear. Then, just as quickly, she was back. "Oh? Where did she go?" Jenny wondered.

  They started chatting as they walked to the benches.

  "So, what do you do in your free time?" Jenny asked, smiling to herself at knowing exactly what Joyce was going to answer.

  "I play games," Joyce said. "All kinds of games. Recently I've been into this small daily challenge called Redactle."

  Jenny's internal monologue screeched to a halt. Redactle? In the main timeline, they hadn't gotten into Redactle until much, much later. What gives?

  "Oh Redactle," she said casually, watching Joyce's face for a reaction. "I like it too. I once played with someone who solved it in three attempts. It was pretty impressive." The person, of course, was Joyce.

  "Very impressive indeed," Joyce replied, with absolutely no flicker of recognition.

  So the timeline is mostly reset, but some details from the future have bled through?

  "What about you?" Joyce asked. "What do you do in your free time?"

  "I also play games! Well, one game. I play Maplestory."

  "Maplestory," Joyce nodded knowingly. "Grinding and cubing, eh?"

  Before Jenny's brain could stop her, she blurted out, "Do you want to come to my place and see my cat that can do somersaults?"

"20251116": |-
  "I... um..." For a pure second Joyce was stunned into silence.

  Did Jenny just hit her with a variation of that internet pickup-line meme "my house cat knows how to do a backflip"? Is she trying to ask her out? But they just met 20 minutes ago. Nevermind that, what kind of person actually says that in real life? To a complete stranger? Is this what they mean by the "hot-crazy index"? Because Jenny definitely scores high on the "hot" side not gonna lie. Hmm, yes, quite high...... FOCUS! You! Or, was she trying to make a joke? A high-risk, unknown reward joke to attempt. She bet this would not work on 99% of the people. Now that she thinks about it though, it is indeed a little bit funny. Haha

  "Hey, you froze," the voice cut in, pulling her back from her internal monologue. "Come back. Yoohoo. Jenny is staring... at your mouth?"

  "Throw in a backflip and we have a deal?" She smirked. Two can play this game.

  "Oh," Jenny said, her eyes now glimmering with amusement and... relief? "That's extra, and thus will incur a small, friendly fee... but I'm sure we can find a way to manage that. I propose we meet over badminton again sometime next week to discuss the arrangement? I know of a community center that has drop-ins on Wednesday and Thursday."

  "Bet. Wanna exchange contact?" Joyce pulled out her phone for Jenny to look up her Instagram.

  "Done. I see your follow request... and I will accept you... now!" Jenny exclaimed, a little too triumphantly.

  Immediately, Joyce got a new message from her.

  🍮

  "Custard?"

  "Creme brulee"

  "Why?" Joyce looked up from the screen to Jenny's face.

  Jenny shrugged.

  "Okay sure, be your mysterious and charming self and don't tell me." Joyce thought.

  "Ah, I have to take care of something now." Jenny looked over at her bag, from which a muffled "happy happy happy" jingle was coming through. "Bye for now!" She smiled at Joyce and hurried away.

  Joyce stood there, trying to process what had just transpired.

  "What kind of strange game are you two playing?" The voice said in an entertained tone, "is it how you kids flirt nowadays?"

  "I.. you... I don't know," Joyce stammered, both to the voice and to herself. "It feels like she knows something she isn't sharing." First the flicker of recognition, and now... this. It was all so baffling.

  She stared at the 🍮 in their chat.

  As if on cue, a new text came from Jenny: "So I will see you this coming Thursday, at North Toronto community center?" Below was a Google maps link to the location.

  "Isn't there a rule where you have to wait three days before asking someone out for a date?" The voice chimes in again, sounding like a sports commentator analyzing the game. "She only just left. This one is forward, eh?"

  "It's just a friendly hang. Don't overthink it." Although, Joyce would not admit to the voice that she almost couldn't contain the smile when she saw the text.

"20251117": |-
  The happy turtle was doing its thing. How long had the disco lights been flashing? How long had the a cappella jingle been looping? Jenny hadn't noticed until a lull in the ambient noise allowed the cheerful chaos to finally break through. She found the unmarked button again and silenced it.

  The device activated. This could mean a game event was triggered nearby. There are many variables though. Signal delay: Unknown. Effective radius: Unknown. False alarm rate: Unknown. Before further inspection and more data points, no conclusion can be drawn yet.

  "I need more data." Jenny muttered. She had a plan.

  She quickly gathered her belongings, said goodbyes to the badminton group, and headed back home.

  Before getting on her bike, she hesitated for a few seconds.

  "Ah. I guess why not." She sent Joyce a text. "Badminton this coming Thursday?" She knew it was probably too fast, too eager... but on well, she was never known for being subtle, even if she once thought she was. The memory of how Joyce had affectionately called her out made her smile.

  "Loool ok see you then!" Immediately Joyce texted back. Had she been looking at their chat?

  Thinking about their interaction... Jenny was relieved that Joyce hadn't been turned off by that awkward pickup line. To Joyce, it must've been incredibly weird. They had just met after all. But oh, Joyce had played along. It was the same quick-witted, playful energy that had made Jenny fall for her in the first place.

  "And now we have a date!" Jenny felt like there was a hyperactive cat doing zoomies in her chest. Well, to Joyce, it was probably just a friendly hang, and Jenny wouldn't push it. Slow and steady. She would do it right.

  ---

  Back in her condo, the first thing that Jenny did was to fetch the guitar from the gig bag sitting next to her desk. She strummed a chord, took a breath, and started:

  "We're going up, up, up..."

  "... like I'm BORN TO BE!"

  Hm, no, a bit too flat.

  "... like I'm BORN TO BE!!"

  Still not quite right. She took another breath, belting it out with more force than melody.

  "LIKE I'M BOOORN TO BE!!!"

  Click. A section of the floor slid open, revealing a sleek, unassuming Apple laptop.

  This was the computer she used for her real work.

  When she booted it up, the screen came to life with a cascade of green text against a stark black background.

  "Maybe it's time to change out of this retro hacker colorscheme. I think I've grown out of it." Jenny mused. "But no. No distraction with config updates today. Bigger fish to fry."

  After a few moments of vigorous, clattering typing, a one-time, utterly untraceable, secure connection was established.

  A new windowed opened.

  "Hey."

  "Badminton tomorrow?" She typed back.

  "Sure."

  "Bring feathers"

  "Ok."

  She closed the connection, the green text vanishing into the black. She double checked no all the traces of the activities that just happened were properly erased, and then, she closed the computer.

  The hidden compartment slid soundlessly shut.

  "Phew. Intense work." She collapsed onto the couch.

  "Now, an equally important question: what do I wear on our upcoming date?"

"20251118": |-
  "Anyway," Joyce said as she walked down Dundas, her blue badminton bag slung over her shoulder, "the more important question is, why did I get the star back there? There wasn't a moral dilemma. I didn't find a wallet or control a trolley that was going to run people over."

  "Hmm," the voice mused. "Maybe you got it because you stepped out of your comfort zone and made a meaningful connection? Maybe you played badminton really well? Maybe it has something to do with that person you were flirting with, Jenny?"

  "Aren't you supposed to know? Go check your logs and figure it out."

  "I don't have access to the logs. They do not exist. I never set them up for the game lifecycle."

  "... Isn't it web development 101 that observability can make or break your application? That you are just setting yourself up for failure if you don't have good monitoring?" As much as she was starting to feel annoyed, she also was slightly puzzled at where she got those knowledge from. Osmosis from someone else? But who?

  "... You are absolutely right." The voice admitted.

  "Don't you-are-absolutely-right me. Go fix it."

  "It's too late to set up the logs now."

  "So you are saying we are entirely at the whims of this black box system. For all we know, it could have given me that star because someone in Montreal decided to eat two poutines instead of one."

  "That is logically correct, but displays an extremely low faith in my programming ability." The voice sounded slightly hurt.

  "You have to earn it, you know." Her annoyance was still there, but her voice softened a little.

  Back in her apartment, Joyce did a full inventory of her current state. She checked her physical belongings and then her digital ones, scrolling through chat messages and contacts to make sure everything was as she remembered last, from her prime timeline. When she got to her Instagram, she saw the chat with Jenny again. She thought of that moment, the way Jenny had stared at her mouth. "What were you thinking, stranger?"

  She didn't dislike it, which surprised her. She wasn't one for fast passions, which are usually built on glorified first impressions. She preferred going slow. At the very least, she needs to confirm first the other person wasn't a secret agent or something

  ... because it would be a big mess if both of them were.

  With a sigh, she reached into her backpack and slowly extracted a pair of sleek, black sunglasses. She put them on. The world inside her apartment immediately took on a cooler, sharper hue.

  "Activate," she commanded.

  A calm, English voice spoke directly into her ear. "What is the final number when you combine three and four?"

  She arranged the fingers on her both hands, bending each one as she counted.

  "Seven. No... six?"

  "... Finger movement verified... correctly incorrect answer verified... Welcome back, Agent Joyce."

  The air in front of her shimmered. What was just a moment ago her bedroom wall was now overlaid with a translucent grid of glowing data timelines, each organized into a neat folder structure.

  "Alright," Joyce said to herself, cracking her finger knuckles, "time to do some XLOOKUPs."
