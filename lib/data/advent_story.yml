  "Haiya. Another 8pm meeting." Thought Joyce. "Getting in the way of meeting my wonderful, sweet, absolutely-right girlfriend. What is adulting." As she plopped into her desk chair, she looked out through the window. It had gone completely dark hours ago. The relentless November wind seemed to only get stronger. A wistful image of Jenny in her volleyball jersey flickered through her mind. Shaking it off, she tuned into the virtual call, her face arranging itself into the familiar mask of pleasant attentiveness.

  As the usual faces began to trickle into the virtual room, she felt...something was weird. Not from the screen. She looked down at the "superstar! I got my COVID-19 shot" sticker that she was fidgeting with, and realized it's...glowing?

  Huh?

  The glow intensified, spilling over the cartoon letters. Then came a great, pulling sensation, not from below, but from the sticker itself. It tugged at her arm, then her whole being, as the sticker grew, expanding with an impossible, silent speed. The cartoon star swelled until it was the size of her monitor, then the wall, soon, her entire room was gone, replaced by a dizzying, swirling vortex of stars.

  "...much wow?" was her last thought before she sank deep, deep into the current.

  "Ah, my back," Joyce grumbles as she climbed the stairs out of the subway station. As she emerged into the snow-covered February air, she tried to shake off the remnants of a very strange dream she’d had while dozing on the train. There was a collage of half-memories: an 8pm meeting...someone in a black volleyball jersey that looked very, very good on them...stars...falling...

  She was running errands in the neighbourhood she was moving to tomorrow. It wouldn't be the first time she’d lived in downtown Toronto, but it would be the first time she'd have a room that was entirely her own.

  "(Cough) Um, hello?" Suddenly, a voice came. From inside her head.

  "What do you mean??" Joyce growled in disbelief.

  "Ah, yes. It appears we've encountered an unexpected user onboarding flow in the game," the voice continued.

  "Wait what? What game? Who are you? And why are you in my head?"

  "Oh no. This is also indicative of the malfunction. Hmm. The parameters may have exceeded initial projections. This might not go well. Oh well."

  "...'Oh well'!?"

  "Um, I mean, rest assured we are actioning a deep-dive to leverage our core competencies and remediate this unfortunate outcome. We understand your frustration—which is a key pain point we're tracking—and will circle back once we have a more granular go-forward strategy."

  "Stop with the corporate speak." Joyce said, deadpan.

  "Okay, phew. Honestly? Running out of bandwidth for that dialect anyway. So, like, no cap, the whole situation is a major L right now. The vibe is... not it. It's giving main character tragedy arc, you feel me?"

  "Stop with the Gen Z speak." Joyce's patience is wearing very thin.

  "...fine. I practiced hard and have grown rather fond of that though. Sigh. Byebye my hard work. Anyway, okay. Let me verify your identity first."

  "...Why do you need authentication when you can already pry into my head? And who are you!??"

  "...you...shush. Although, I find that rather silly too. But trust me it, the faster we get this over with, the faster I will be able to answer your questions. First, what is your name?"

  "Joyce. This is stupid."

  "What piece of clothing is the most scandalous?"

  "No-show socks. Because they reveal the ankles."

  Very good. Final question: what is the name of that establishment where food may or may not be their main focus, but does have a good chicken wings deal on Mondays?

  "Hooters," the voice confirmed, with the air of a game show host confirming a prize-winning answer. "A correct identification. You seem quite emphatic about it. ALL CAPS?"

  "...don't worry about it. Now, what is this game and why are you in my head?" To punctuate the question, and to test the very integrity of this reality, Joyce stalked over to the nearest wall, and gave it a solid kick.

  "Ouch!" The pain that shot up her leg was definitely real.

  "Why did you initiate a wall-walking sequence and then abort on the first step?" The voice asked with an air of genuine scientific curiosity.

  "...That was a kick."

  "Oh. I see."

  "You are judging me. Stop it."

  "I didn't say anything! Ahem, anyway," continued the voice, "this game I have been referring to is..."

  "Hmm?"

  "..."

  "...?"

  "...a game."

  "Ok have a nice day I would like to log out of whatever this is now bye bye"

  "I am sorry but you have to stay with me for a while." The voice actually managed to sound apologetic. "The game doesn't have a formal name yet as it's still in a pre-beta development phase. But we developers do have a nickname for it. 'That Game Where You Collect Stars When Going About Your Everyday Activities'"

  "I feel that is unnecessarily long for a nickname. It doesn't even rhyme."

  "What do you mean? It is such a catchy nickname that says it all! Anyway, this game was developed with the goal of adding some...behavioral incentives for people to make good choices. We designed for pre-teen children as a form of early-stage behaviour conditioning. When a kid encounters a morally ambiguous situation, the game will activate. When they make the right decision, the game will reward them with a star. So they can be trained from a young age to make good decisions and be better adults when they grow up. We are in the first stage of testing now, and to ensure our subjects were of our targeted age, our demographic filter was to randomly select subjects from the pool of recipients of the 'superstar! I got my COVID-19 shot!' sticker."

  "...Which included me, a 26-year-old."

  "We simply didn't expect someone as old as you would get the sticker."

  Joyce wanted to protest but...fair point. "I don't even remember taking a flu shot. How weird. Also, now I have even more questions. First of all, I didn't consent to any of these. How did I become the subject? Also, what counts as a morally ambiguous situation?"

  "Oh but you did give your consent. Remember that one time you streamed a baseball event from Daddylive? If you had perused the Terms of Service section 133 subection 121.9 clause 42, on the back of line three it did say 'and I hereby agree to participate wholeheartedly in the game colloquially nicknamed "That Game Where You Collect Stars When Going About Your Everyday Activities" at my own personal physical and mental risk.'"

  "Very sus, to say the least. Be honest, are you for real? And WHAT DO YOU MEAN physical and mental risk!??"

  "I...want to tell you don't worry about that but...maybe worry a little bit? A fractional amount. A light touch of worry is probably appropriate. You don't have to worry too much. Yet. Anyway! The important thing is that you are here now, so let's focus on that. So," its tone brightening with the unmistakable relief of someone who has successfully dodged a very difficult question, "you asked what situations are defined as morally ambiguous. Easy. For example, when you find a wallet full of cash on the road, do you take the cash and leave the wallet, or do you try to return it to its owner? Another good example would be: you are walking on a mildly busy street and wish to cross. The nearest designated crosswalk is a whole ten metres away. You see a momentary lull in traffic, do you jaywalk?"
